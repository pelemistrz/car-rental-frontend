Overview
Car Rental is a web application that allows users to rent cars. The application is built using a combination of technologies to provide a smooth and secure user experience.

Technologies Breakdown
Backend:
The server-side of the application is built using Java with the Spring Boot framework (version 3). The backend is responsible for handling requests, processing data, and interacting with the database.

Frontend:
For the frontend, I used Angular and Bootstrap to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.

Database:
The database is powered by MySQL, where all data regarding cars, users, and transactions are stored.

Authentication & Authorization:
The application utilizes Keycloak for OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standards. Keycloak is used for user authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access. It also manages user registration and password reset functionality.
